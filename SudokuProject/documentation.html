                <b>Main Page and Login: </b>When first visiting, a user will see the
                index page explaining how to play the game and giving a brief description
                of the game logic based on the assignment description. There is a link to 
                this Documentation page as well as a button to play the game. When the user
                clicks this button, if they have not logged in, a pop up will appear asking for
                login information. A list of valid username/password combinations can be
                found <a href="http://universe.tc.uvu.edu/cs3550/assignments/PasswordCheck/list.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
                If the user has already logged in, the login pop up will not appear and
                they will be taken straight to the game page. If the user attempts to go to
                the game page url without having logged in it will display a message telling
                them they must login to play.<br/><br/>
                <b>The Game Selection Page: </b> After logging in, the user is taken to the
                game selection page where they may choose a game based on difficulty level.
                There are three difficulty levels with three games each, as well as a debug level.<br/><br/>
                <b>Playing the Game: </b>To play, a user must enter a number into an empty square and 
                press the enter button to submit the value. To edit a value, they must double click on the number.
                When the game is finished and all the values are correct a pop up will display 
                congratulating the user and showing their time, the timer will stop, and the user's 
                score will be saved using HTML5's localStorage based on the amount of time 
                elapsed. When viewing the same game page again the
                top five users with the quickest times will be listed for that game.
                Refreshing the page will result in the loss of current game, as it will 
                take the user back to the game selection page.<br/><br/>
                <b>The Instructions Button: </b>On each game page there is a button for Instructions
                on how to play the game. Clicking it shows a pop up window with information
                about how to play the game, and pauses the timer.<br/><br/>
                <b>The Check My Answers Button: </b>Each game page also has a Check My Answers
                button. Clicking the button will call a function that loops through
                all of the values entered in the grid and compare these with the game's 
                corresponding answers grid which is hard-coded in another JavaScript file.
                This button will only work on the values that were submitted using the enter key,
                so if there are values in some text fields that have not been submitted they 
                will be looked over. If the user's answers are correct they will be alerted 
                that there are no errors. If there are incorrect values entered, the numbers
                will turn red and shake, using the <a href="http://jackrugile.com/jrumble/" target="_blank">jRumble plugin</a>. 
                To change an incorrect value, just double click it.<br/><br/>
                <b>The Player List: </b>This is a list of players that was hard-coded in the
                players.xml file. The players values are read using an XMLHttpRequest and 
                inserted into the navbar. The XML seems to only display properly in Firefox 
                when viewing the pages locally.<br/><br/>
                <b>The Debug Level: </b>This is a grid containing all 1's, so the user may enter 
                the last two 1's to see quickly what happens upon game completion. I used this grid
                for debugging the congratulations pop up, timer behavior, localStorage implementation,
                and to verify whether the user had in fact entered all correct values.
