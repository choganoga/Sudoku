README - About this project

This is a final project I completed for my CS 3550 (Internet Software Development) online class in the Summer 
2012 semester at Utah Valley University. I had about 6 weeks to complete it and there were various requirements
that I had to meet, so it may not be the most elegant code in the world, but for the most part it functions the
way I had intended. The code has not been touched since the class ended so it may have some bugs.

The documentation.html file explains a little more about the project's requirements, while the checkpoint.html
file was created halfway through the project's completion and is out of date.


As for the puzzles, I had originally wanted to create an algorithm to generate random sudoku puzzles but I 
ended up running out of time, so I resorted to hard-coding each of the puzzles as well as their answers. This 
resulted in the gridData.js file being well over 1,000 lines of code. I realize is definitely not the most
efficient way to solve the problem, but it worked so I went with it.

Anyway, thanks for reading and enjoy the games!
